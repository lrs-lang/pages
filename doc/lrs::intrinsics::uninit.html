Note that this is <b>not</b> the same as creating an object that contains the bytes that were previously stored in the memory location the object is stored in. If the returned object is used before it is properly initialized, the behavior is undefined.</p><h2>See also</h2><ul><li><p><a href="./lrs::mem::uninit.html">lrs::mem::uninit</a></p></li></ul></body></html>
